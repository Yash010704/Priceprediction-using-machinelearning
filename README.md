# Price Prediction Model

## This repository contains a machine learning-based price prediction model that estimates prices of properties based on various features such as area type, availability, location, size, society, total square footage, number of bathrooms, balconies, and price.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict property prices using features such as area type, location, and other property details. This can assist users in making informed decisions when buying or selling properties.

## Features

- Predict prices based on key attributes such as:
  - Area type (e.g., Built-up, Carpet, Super Built-up)
  - Availability (e.g., Ready to Move, Under Construction)
  - Location (specific neighborhood or district)
  - Size (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK)
  - Society (name of the housing society)
  - Total square footage
  - Number of bathrooms
  - Number of balconies
- Scalable and easy to adapt for other attributes.
- User-friendly interface for predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/price-prediction-model.git](https://github.com/Yash010704/Priceprediction-using-machinelearning.git)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd price-prediction-model
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset)).
2. Train the model using the provided scripts:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Use the trained model to make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --area_type <area_type> --availability <availability> --location <location> --size <size> --society <society> --total_sqft <total_sqft> --bath <bath> --balcony <balcony>
   ```

Example:

```bash
python predict.py --area_type "Built-up" --availability "Ready to Move" --location "Downtown" --size "2 BHK" --society "Palm Grove" --total_sqft 1200 --bath 2 --balcony 1
```

4. For additional options, refer to the `--help` command:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --help
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset should include the following columns:

- `area_type`: Type of area (e.g., Built-up, Carpet, Super Built-up).
- `availability`: Status of the property (e.g., Ready to Move, Under Construction).
- `location`: Textual descriptions of neighborhoods or districts.
- `size`: Number of bedrooms (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK).
- `society`: Name of the housing society.
- `total_sqft`: Numeric values representing the total property size.
- `bath`: Number of bathrooms.
- `balcony`: Number of balconies.
- `price`: Numeric values representing the property prices.

You can use a sample dataset provided in the `data/` directory or prepare your own. Ensure the data is cleaned and formatted before training the model.

## Model

The model is built using the following techniques:

- Data preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.
- Feature selection: Identifies key predictors of property prices.
- Machine learning: Uses algorithms like linear regression, random forests, or gradient boosting.

You can modify the `config.py` file to customize model parameters and hyperparameters.
