Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict property prices using features such as area type, location, and other property details. This can assist users in making informed decisions when buying or selling properties.

Features

Predict prices based on key attributes such as:

Area type (e.g., Built-up, Carpet, Super Built-up)

Availability (e.g., Ready to Move, Under Construction)

Location (specific neighborhood or district)

Size (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK)

Society (name of the housing society)

Total square footage

Number of bathrooms

Number of balconies

Scalable and easy to adapt for other attributes.

Dataset

The dataset should include the following columns:

area_type: Type of area (e.g., Built-up, Carpet, Super Built-up).

availability: Status of the property (e.g., Ready to Move, Under Construction).

location: Textual descriptions of neighborhoods or districts.

size: Number of bedrooms (e.g., 2 BHK, 3 BHK).

society: Name of the housing society.

total_sqft: Numeric values representing the total property size.

bath: Number of bathrooms.

balcony: Number of balconies.

price: Numeric values representing the property prices.

You can use a sample dataset provided in the data/ directory or prepare your own. Ensure the data is cleaned and formatted before training the model.

Model

The model is built using the following techniques:

Data preprocessing: Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.

Feature selection: Identifies key predictors of property prices.

Machine learning: Uses algorithms like linear regression, random forests, or gradient boosting.

You can modify the config.py file to customize model parameters and hyperparameters.
